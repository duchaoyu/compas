COMPAS releases are available on the Python Package Index (PyPI), on ``conda-forge``
or directly from the Github repo.

Versions are tagged following the Semantic Versioning (semver) convention of ``MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH``.
For more information see `Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 <https://semver.org/>`_.

The API of ``COMPAS`` was under heavy development up until ``COMPAS 0.19``,
the last version series before ``1.0``.

Starting with ``1.0`` the API has been stabilized and the project adheres strictly to
semver. In addition to the version number, major releases also have a name
following the pattern ``<geometric adjective> <nautical term>``, with the words
forming a tautogram in which the first letter increases alphabetically on every major
release and rolls back to A after reaching Z. For example: ``COMPAS 16.0: Projective Pirate``.
