    Blender is the free and open source 3D creation suite.
    It supports the entirety of the 3D pipeline—modeling,

    even video editing and game creation.

    Blender is cross-platform and runs equally well on Linux, Windows, and Macintosh computers.
    Its interface uses OpenGL to provide a consistent experience.
